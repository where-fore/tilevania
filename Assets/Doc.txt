current issues:
coin pickup sound does not follow camera

water only kills player when it rises to touch their head, instead of whenver their head hitbox contacts the water

please add music

if you hold a while you start to climb a ladder, your animation is locked into the running left animation instead of climbing



how to change timescale
-locally when needed, like in Player.cs
-through a public static class
    -> how to reset
        -timer/delay
        -on
-

to do:

fix ladders so you snap to them so you don't get caught under a ledge, unable to move horizontally

finesse camera - too much movement right now
